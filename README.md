## Overview

Please Implement a component that displays available repositories using GitHub API

Example Github user with repos: [Adobe Consulting Services](https://api.github.com/users/adobe-consulting-services/repos)


## Requirements

### Local Environment
- Adobe AEM 6.5+
- HTL for component development

### Authoring

Component would allow author to configure:

- User name (“adobe-consulting-services” above)
- Maximum number of result items shown

### Rendering

When rendered on the page, component will display results in a table form, with each line showing:

- Repository name
- Repository URL
- Owner name
- Owner Avatar

Use any technology stack you are comfortable with. For example:

- Serverside Java stack - Use the builtin [Java HTTP service in Oracle JRE](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3732328)
- Clientside stack - Javascript, CSS, HTML

### Notes

Functionality can pull content directly from GitHub API. No need to worry about caching.
No need to worry about styling. Basic HTML table is acceptable.
No need for custom page template. Component can be used/added to OOB pages.

## Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. 

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
